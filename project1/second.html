<body><h1>Hizbullah is crying, what should Israel do?</h1>
    As the war in Gaza escalates, there are signs of something more dangerous on Israel's northern border. Another proxy militia of Iran located in Lebanon, Hezbollah, has been carrying out rocket and drone attacks on northern Israel since the day after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 last year. Thousands of acres of land were burnt in the attack. 70,000 Israelis who were evacuated have not yet returned home. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also hit back, forcing 90,000 people to flee their homes in southern Lebanon. Israel killed an influential Hezbollah leader on July 3. A direct war could turn into the biggest conflict in the region in decades.

    <p>Israel currently has no good answer to the 'Hezbollah threat'. That means, they should try to avoid war right now.</p>

    <p>The threat posed by Hezbollah to Israel is not new, but it is now more serious than ever. By making parts of northern Israel uninhabitable, Hezbollah has left the Jewish state in an intolerable situation.</p>

    <p>
        Israelis are understandably angered by the presence of an enemy on their border that resembles a 'Hamas-style' attack. Israel's 2006 invasion of Lebanon was aimed at pushing Hezbollah away from the border. As a result, the two sides engaged in a 34-day bloody war.</p>

        <p>Israel believes it has weakened the militia group in that war. Now, with renewed fighting there, some officials have warned that the devastation would make Gaza look like 'paradise' if it does happen.</p>

        <p>Indeed, another war now would be disastrous for both Israel and Lebanon. Compared to 2006, Hezbollah's weapons are now much stronger. They have 150,000 missiles in their arsenal, some of which are capable of hitting Tel Aviv. They can penetrate Israel's air defenses and destroy critical infrastructure.</p>

           <p> Israeli officials always spoke of a short but sharp war. But in 1982, the IDF got stuck in the mud while carrying out the invasion. Even in 2006, Hezbollah put up a strong resistance. Civilian casualties in the new war will be horrendous, as Hezbollah has established bases scattered across villages and towns. A bankrupt Lebanese state could collapse, creating utter chaos. Now a conflict there could escalate into a regional war involving Iran and its proxies. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has warned of an "endless" war, while Iran is talking about a war of "annihilation" (Iran threatens to wipe Israel off the world map).</p>
